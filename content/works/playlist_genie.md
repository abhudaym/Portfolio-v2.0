## The Problem: 20 Minutes to Find the Right Song

You open Spotify thinking *"I want some upbeat gym tracks"* and end up in playlist purgatoryâ€”jumping between auto-generated lists, skipping songs that don't match your vibe, wondering why Spotify thinks you want death metal for your morning jog.

**The personal trigger:** I'm a huge fan of Jeremy Zucker and Lauv. I had tons of their songs scattered across my library, but I didn't want to spend 30 minutes manually hunting through my 2000+ saved tracks to create the perfect Jeremy + Lauv playlist.

I just wanted to say *"Give me a chill Jeremy Zucker and Lauv vibe"* and have AI automatically pull the best tracks from my library. Why should I do the boring work when AI could understand exactly what I meant?

**The bigger pain:** We have thousands of playlists but never the one we want *right now*. Manual playlist creation is tedious, and Spotify's search gives us random songs outside our taste.

## The Solution: One Prompt, Perfect Playlist

I built **PlaylistGenie** in a weekendâ€”an AI-powered Spotify wrapper that transforms a single text prompt into a curated playlist in seconds.

**How it works:**
- Describe your vibe: *"late-night road trip"*, *"Bollywood disco era"*, *"focus beats for coding"*
- Choose playlist size (10, 20, 50 songs)
- Pick **Library Mode** (only your saved tracks) or **Discovery Mode** (global catalog)

**The magic:** It feels like telling a friend what you're in the mood for and getting the perfect playlist instantly.

## How It Works

Simple concept: Type what you're feeling, get the perfect playlist instantly.

**The Experience:**
- Enter a vibe: *"chill Jeremy Zucker and Lauv vibes"*, *"late-night road trip"*, *"focus beats for coding"*
- Choose playlist size and whether to stick to your library or explore new music
- AI analyzes your prompt, understands the mood, and curates the perfect mix
- Playlist appears in your Spotify account, ready to play

**The magic:** It feels like having a friend who knows your music taste perfectly and can instantly create exactly what you need.
